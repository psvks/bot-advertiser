# Bot Advertiser.

Hello and welcome to the official bot advertiser github  
please note this is not for playing its for advertising, **you have a great potential to be banned**.
We are not responsible for the bans, ***you are responsible for them and we are not responsible for them.***

## Notes.

As I have mentioned in other projects this is only for educational purposes.  
I am not responsible for any charges. **The project will not be updated.**

## Installation.

1- **Go to your exploit folder.**  
2- **Once inside head over to the workspace folder**  
3- **Insert or grab and drop the folders `config`, `handler`, `src` for fully working**  
4- **Go to your exploit folder again.**  
5- **Head over to the `autoexec` and grab the file `loader.lua` and then drop.**  
6- **Configure your `loader.lua`**  

Once done you can advertise!  
The files are open source if roblox patches this, you can fix it

## Docs.

```py
getRamdomMath(<string>, <number>)

-- In the first string you get two options: *game* and *chat* to generate a ramdom number.
-- The second string will be the number. The number has to match the games or chats that you have configured.


For example:

games = {
    "this id", -- first
    "this id", -- second
    "this id", -- third
    "this id", -- fourth
}


Output: Ramdom. It can be 1 up to 4

```

---

```py
say(<void>)

-- The ramdom message selected.
-- Ok?


For example:

chatSettings = {
    "This is the first",
    "This is the second"
    "This is the third",
}


Output: Ramdom. It can be 1 up to 3

```

---

```py
say_and_rejoin(<void>)

-- The ramdom message selected.
-- And rejoins a game in games config

```
